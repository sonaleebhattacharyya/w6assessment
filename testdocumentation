Overview: We can test that when you click on "Add to Duo", the bot gets added at the bottom. 
How to reproduce this: 
We will go to the application and click on the button labelled "Add to Duo". 
The bot should get added at the bottom of the page. 
Repeat this process for all of the bots to check that it works.
